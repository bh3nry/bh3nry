      <p>Every public repository here reflects something that either pushed me beyond my comfort zone or sparked real joy as I strive to become a better developer.
      </p>
      <p>Sharing my work publicly is a habit I’m trying to practice more intentionally. There are so many great ideas <i>(or almost ideas)</i> worth sharing, and I hope these projects can be useful to other developers   building on similar concepts. With that said, each repository represents a topic that’s had a real impact on me and my learning as I’ve grown to find my place in the world of software development.
      </p>

      <p>Thanks for being here!</p>

## Log: Jan 21, 2026

> Right now, I’m focused on the fundamentals of data science and machine learning, and on applying those ideas in my own projects. One book that’s helped in shaping how I think about this is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction">**“Weapons of Math Destruction”**.</a> As AI becomes more prominent, I feel a responsibility to understand how models inherit bias and what developers can do to reduce its impact.
