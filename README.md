      <h3>Hi, hello!</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Bren. Any public repository listed was a topic that either pushed me out of my comfort zone or facilitated joy in my endeavour to learn and enjoy the process of writing code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharing any collection of work out in the open is an encouraging practice that I’m trying to be more mindful of, as there are so many great ideas that deserve platforming that other developers can build upon. With that said, any repository that you see here is an idea or topic that has positively impacted me and my learning journey into all things software development.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for being here!</p>

> My current area of interest is in exploring the fundamentals of data science and machine learning concepts, by figuring out ways in which I can apply that to my own life.
>
> A book that has been deeply fascinating on this topic is **“Weapons of Math Destruction”**. As AI continues to rise in prominence, I feel as though it is a deep responsibility to understand how models adopt certain biases, and how developers can mitigate against that.
