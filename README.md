      <p>Sharing my work publicly is a habit I’m trying to practice more intentionally. Any public repos listed here exist purely for the sake of fun, curiosity, or           as a means of pushing me out of my comfort zone.
      </p>
      <p>There are so many great ideas <i>(or almost ideas)</i> worth sharing; I hope these projects can be useful to other developers and create some visibility around making stuff for the sake of making stuff.
      </p>
  <p>With that said, if you find any of this interesting, please feel free to reach out and share your thoughts.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Thanks for being here!</p>

## Log: Jan 21, 2026

> Right now, I’m focused on the fundamentals of data science and machine learning, and on applying those ideas in my own projects. One book that’s helped in shaping how I think about this is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction">**“Weapons of Math Destruction”**.</a> As AI becomes more prominent, I feel a responsibility to understand how models inherit bias and what developers can do to reduce its impact.
